\chapter{The Basic Set-up and Structure of a \LaTeX{} Book}

\paragraph{Introduction}
The first chapter discusses how to properly configure \LaTeX{} files and organize the content's structure so that we can generate our first readable \LaTeX{} book PDF. 

\section{Class, Commands, Options, and Packages}
\label{sec:komaopt}

\paragraph{Class}
For each \LaTeX{} document, we need to specify its \textit{class}. Throughout this book, we will use the \verb|scrbook| class provided by the \textbf{KOMA-Script}. To do so, we write \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass\{scrbook\}} at the very beginning (\textit{preamble}) of the main \TeX{} file. Although not explored in this book, some other notable classes that may be of use include \verb|beamer|, \verb|moderncv|, and \verb|article| (or \verb|scrartcl|).

\paragraph{Commands and Options} The \verb|scrbook| class provides several \textit{options} to customize the format of the book. We can either supply the arguments when declaring the class, or use the command \texttt{\textbackslash KOMAoptions} in the preamble. A \textit{command} works like a function in common programming languages and performs some specific action. Commands in \LaTeX{} are denoted by the backslash \verb|\| as the first character. In this book, we have used
\begin{lstlisting}
\KOMAoptions{paper=a4, fontsize=12pt, chapterprefix=true, twoside=semi, DIV=classic, parskip=half}
\end{lstlisting}
The arguments are typed inside the curly brackets \verb|{}| following the name of the command. Clearly, the \verb|paper| option requires the pages to be in A4 size while \verb|fontsize| indicates that the font is 12 pt large. The remaining options will be explained as we go through the later chapters.

\paragraph{Packages} To enable extra functionalities, we need to import \textit{packages}. We can write along the lines of \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage[<options>]\{<package\_name>\}} to do so. We will not list all the required packages now at once, but only when they are needed. The first package we usually need is the \verb|fontenc| package with the \verb|T1| option, flagged inside a pair of square brackets.

\begin{exercisebox}
\begin{Exercise}
Try to import the \verb|fontenc| package with the \verb|T1| option as suggested above. There may not be any noticeable difference, but at least you should not be receiving errors.
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Exercise}
Also, try to use \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[<options>]\{scrbook\}} instead of the \texttt{\textbackslash KOMAoptions} command to achieve the same class setting.
\end{Exercise}
\end{exercisebox}

\section{Structure Hierarchy}

\subsection{Chapters and (Sub-)Sections}

\paragraph{Chapters, Sections} As in any other book, the entire content is divided into \textit{chapters}, which in turn usually consist of several \textit{sections}. To mark the beginning of a chapter or section, we place the commands \texttt{\textbackslash chapter\{<chapter\_name>\}} or \texttt{\textbackslash section\{<section\_name>\}} within the \verb|document| environment, which contains the main content and is marked by a pair of \verb|begin| and \verb|end| declarations. So, to typeset the very first section at the start, we write
\begin{lstlisting}
<preamble before the main document>
\begin{document}
...
\chapter{The Basic Set-up and Structure of a \LaTeX{} Book}
...
\section{Class, Options, and Packages}
\paragraph{Class}
For each \LaTeX{} document, we need to specify its \textit{class}. Throughout this book, ...
...
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
The \LaTeX{} system updates the chapter/section's numbering internally. The \texttt{\textbackslash textit\{<text>\}} command presents the text in italic shape.

\paragraph{Subsections, Paragraphs} An attentive reader may have already figured out that it is possible to stack an extra layer (a \textit{subsection}) in the hierarchy. This is aptly done not long ago by the \texttt{\textbackslash subsection} command:
\begin{lstlisting}
\section{Structure Hierarchy}

\subsection{Chapters and (Sub-)Sections}

\paragraph{Chapters, Sections} As in any other book, the entire content is divided into \textit{chapters}, ...
\end{lstlisting}
He/she may also notice that we have used the \texttt{\textbackslash paragraph} command a few times to attach an unnumbered heading for each \textit{paragraph}.

\subsection{Generating Table of Contents}

\paragraph{Table of Contents}
After establishing the structure of the book, it is convenient to generate a \textit{table of contents (TOC)} as well. In the \verb|scrbook| class, it is easily done by adding the command \texttt{\textbackslash tableofcontents} within the main \verb|document| group. To control the depth of layers shown, we can call \texttt{\textbackslash setcounter{tocdepth}\allowbreak\{<integer>\}} in the preamble, where the \verb|integer| usually ranges from $-1$ to $3$ ($0$: chapters, $1$: sections, $2$: subsections).

\begin{exercisebox}
\begin{Exercise}
Try to add some chapters, sections, subsections, or even subsubsections (which are, not surprisingly, produced by \texttt{\textbackslash subsubsection}) to see how they are displayed in the book. You may want to check out \texttt{\textbackslash part}.
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Exercise}
As a follow-up to the last exercise, turn on the table of contents and confirm how the new entries are linked to it. Also, try to adjust the value for \texttt{\textbackslash setcounter{tocdepth}} as proposed above to see the effect.
\end{Exercise}
\end{exercisebox}

\subsection{Organizing the \TeX{} Files behind the Scenes}
\paragraph{Include} As the size of the project scales up, it is often helpful to keep the files arranged in a clean order for maintenance. We can put the content of each chapter into separate \TeX{} files, and then use the \texttt{\textbackslash include\{<tex\_file\_name>\}} command to import them into the main script. For example, this chapter is stored as \texttt{ch1\_basic\_structure.tex} in my project space, and in the main \TeX{} file, we shall write something like
\begin{lstlisting}
<preamble>
\begin{document}

\tableofcontents
\include{ch1_basic_structure}
...
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Testing the Book Layout by Lipsum}

\paragraph{Dummy Text} Sometimes we may need to insert some placeholder text into the code to test how well the book will look in a specific layout. In this case, we can borrow the standard dummy text \textit{Lorem Ipsum} (or in short \textit{Lipsum}) widely used by the community. Just import the \verb|lipsum| generator package, and add \texttt{\textbackslash lipsum[<paragraph\_no.>]} to the desired positions. For example, the code segment
\begin{lstlisting}
...
produces the following text exactly: \par
\lipsum[1-2]
\end{lstlisting}
produces the following text exactly: \par
\lipsum[1-2] \par
The \texttt{\textbackslash par} command signals the end of a paragraph and appends a vertical line spacing afterwards.
